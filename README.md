# Exploratory-Data-Analysis_project1
My first project (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Task:
For each plot I 

Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.

Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also include the code that creates the PNG file.

Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository


I added 4 plots and 4 r-files to folder
